Notes:

  basic terminal commands: https://gist.github.com/poopsplat/7195274

  how do we run this code through the debugger?
    use browserify: https://github.com/browserify/browserify-handbook#introduction

    cannot install browserify globally to use in command line
    instead, we install a node version manager, in this case from here: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation

    we can use node --inspect-brk [filepath/name]
    this will create a debugger page
    then we go to chrome://inspect
    choose the 

    use karma link to debug the code
    we can use source maps to go straight to the original code and step through it



    Debugging video explanation:

      Explain the context
        Node.js
          loading libraries/modules
        testing framework
        cannot run in chrome

      Explain the problem

      How the book club runs tests
        We use karma, a test runner
        We preprocess the code using browserify so node functions can be used in the browser
        We then run the tests via phantom js, a browser that helps with unit testing

      Explain the solution




      The problem - We are running our code with various dependencies and the code is written with Node.js which is how we are loading modules and we are using a testing framework like Jasmine. As such, we are unable to directly run this code in the browser and cannot debug using Chrome
        Demonstrate the problem





      With karma: we have a way to run jasmine code, it runs it as a regular Node.js module
        Karma starts by loading plugins and configuration file
          all preprocessors, browser launchers, and frameworks are plugins
          karma plugins are using npm modules so we can install them as project dependencies via the package.json
        then it starts a local web server
        browsers will connect to this webserver
        once connected, it will open a context.html file which contains testing framework adapter, source code and test code
        testing framework adapter takes over and runs tests
        We have installed phantomJS which helps us run the code in a browser without the need for a browser
          confirm this!!?
        However, we can access the webserver via this URL:http://localhost:9876/

      With browserify: we can convert the Node.js code to browser friendly code
        Browsers natively don't have the require method predefined like nodeJS does
        With browserify, it will automatically trace all the dependencies within your JS file
        By adding debug flag, you will gain the ability to use source maps


      With phantomJS: we can run the code without a browser and that's how our tests are run

      See how tests fail and how we can activate the debugger
